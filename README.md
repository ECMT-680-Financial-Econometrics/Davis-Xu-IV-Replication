The files in the folder document the process of replicating the results from the paper "Medicare Part D: Are Insurers Gaming the Low Income Subsidy Design?".

The primary files of interest are the dataset.dta file and the IVMedicareReplication.ipynb file, which contain the dataset used by the author of the study and the steps I took to replicate their results in python respectively. The IVMedicareReplication.html file is an html output of the replication process.

The description latex file contains a summary of the paper and its methodology, and the exercise file contains an empirical exercise created for the paper. Finally, the presentation.pdf file contains a presentation poster summarizing the paper and the results from the replication.
