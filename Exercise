Exercise: Medicare Part D: Are Insurers Gaming the Low Income Subsidy Design?

This section examples the work done by Francesco Decarolis. The study examines the strategic behaviors of insurers within the Medicare Part D program, specifically focusing on the manipulation of the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) design to attract low-income enrollees. The instrumental variable used is the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) share in 2006, aiming to capture the insurers' incentives and feasibility for premium manipulation. This methodology allows for an in-depth understanding of the dynamics between subsidy design and premium setting strategies, providing evidence of the distortions in the Medicare Part D market caused by strategic insurer behaviors.

Key Variables and Data Overview
 \textbf{Independent Variable:} The concentration of the Low-Income Premium Subsidy Amount (LIPSA) weights in a given region and year 
 \textbf{Dependent Variable:} The average basic premium of Medicare Part D plans 
 \textbf{Instumental Variable:} The Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) share in 2006 

Reproduction Task: 
Reproduce Table 7 which shows the 2SLS regression results for the analysis

Estimation Tasks:
1. OLS Regression: Estimate the impact of LIPSA weights on the average basic premium of Medicare Part D plans
2. 2SLS Estimation with IV: Use the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) share in 2006 as an instrumental variable for LIPSA weights

Empirical Results from the Study

OLS Regression
Part D Premium = 0.380 + 0.352*{LISPA Concentration} + \epsilon 

First Stage Regression
LISPA Concentration = -0.896 + 0.668*{2006 MA-PD Share} + \epsilon 

Second Stage  Regression
Part D Premium = 0.143 + 0.468*{LISPA Concentration} + \epsilon

Unveiling Stories from the Data

How does the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) share in 2006 relate to the concentration of the Low-Income Premium Subsidy Amount (LIPSA) weights, and what might be the underlying mechanisms?
Explore the potential indirect pathways through which the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) share in 2006 might affect the average basic premium of Medicare Part D plans via the concentration of the Low-Income Premium Subsidy Amount (LIPSA) weights.
Analyze the empirical evidence on the role of the concentration of the Low-Income Premium Subsidy Amount (LIPSA) weights in shaping the average basic premium of Medicare Part D plans. Reflect on the difference between OLS and 2SLS estimates.

Interpreting Regression Results

Considering the first-stage regression results, what does the coefficient of 0.668 indicate about the relationship between Settler Mortality and Institution Quality?
How does the second-stage coefficient of 0.94 enhance our understanding of the impact of Institution Quality on GDP per capita?
Reflect on the OLS results with a coefficient of 0.52. What does this tell us about the direct correlation between Institution Quality and GDP per capita without addressing endogeneity?
